# Bootstrap Your First Zitadel Project

With Zitadel running behind Pangolin, the next step is to replace the bootstrap admin with a dedicated project and owner account. This keeps day-to-day access separate from the installation credentials and prepares Pangolin for single sign-on.

## 1. Create a dedicated project

1. Log into the Zitadel console using the default administrator account.
2. Select your organization from the sidebar and click **Projects → Create Project**.
3. Provide a name such as `Core Platform` or `Pangolin Access`.
4. Leave the initial settings as defaults and confirm.

The project becomes the container for all future clients, APIs, and service users.

## 2. Define roles for the project

1. Inside the project, open the **Roles** tab.
2. Add at least one role, for example:
   - `iam.owner` – Full administrative access
   - `iam.viewer` – Read-only access (optional)
3. Save your changes.

You can add more granular roles later when integrating applications.

## 3. Create your primary user (IAM owner)

1. Navigate to **Users → Create Human User**.
2. Enter your name and email address. Use an email you control (even if you disabled email verification).
3. Assign a temporary password or choose "Set password on first login".
4. After the user is created, open the **Memberships** tab and assign the project role `iam.owner`.

This account replaces the bootstrap admin for routine administration tasks.

### 3.1 Optional: Enforce multi-factor authentication

If you plan to expose Zitadel publicly, enable MFA for the new owner account:

1. Log out and log back in as the new user.
2. Navigate to **Profile → Security → Multi-factor**.
3. Enroll an authenticator app or WebAuthn security key.

## 4. Retire or demote the bootstrap admin

The installation user (`zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost`) was meant for initial setup only. After verifying your new owner login works:

1. Sign back in as the bootstrap admin.
2. Remove its project memberships or deactivate the account entirely.

This ensures only the new dedicated account can administer the environment.

## 5. Prepare for Pangolin SSO configuration

Keep the following details handy—they will be required when Pangolin delegates authentication to Zitadel:

- Project name and ID
- Human user (IAM owner) credentials
- Any additional roles you want to surface to Pangolin (for example `iam.viewer`)

Continue with the [Pangolin Auth Provider Setup](10-pangolin-auth-provider-setup.mdx) guide to connect Zitadel as Pangolin's OpenID Connect provider. For advanced reverse-proxy tuning or troubleshooting, see the optional [Network Configuration Reference](08-network-configuration.mdx).
