# Bootstrap Your First Zitadel Organization and Project

With Zitadel running behind Pangolin, the next step is to replace the bootstrap admin with a dedicated organization and project. This creates a clean separation between the installation's default organization and your personal setup, keeping day-to-day access separate from the installation credentials and preparing Pangolin for single sign-on.

## 1. Create a dedicated organization

1. Log into the Zitadel console using the default administrator account.
2. If not already there, click the **Default Settings** button located next to your profile icon in the top-right corner.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Organizations**.
4. Click the **New** button to create a new organization.
5. **Important**: Uncheck the option **"Use your personal account as organization owner"** since you're logged in with the bootstrap `Zitadel Admin` account.
6. Enter the organization details:
   - **Name**: `KHOrg` (or your preferred organization name)
   - **Domain**: `kylehub.dev` (or your domain)
7. Click **Configure Organization Owner** to set up the initial administrator for this organization.
8. Enter the details for your organization owner user (this will be your main managing user):
   - Username, email, and other profile information
   - Select **Email verified** (since email verification may be disabled)
   - Choose **Set Initial Password**
   - Enter a strong, unique password and save it securely (consider using a password manager)
9. Click **Finish** to complete the organization creation.

You should now have your new organization created with a dedicated owner account. Switch to your new organization using the organization selector in the top-left corner.

## 2.1 Switch to Organization Admin Account (Recommended)

After creating the organization, switch to using your dedicated organization admin account:

1. **Logout** from the bootstrap admin account
2. **Login** using the format: `username@domain` (e.g., `yourusername@kylehub.dev`) with the password you set
3. You should now see your organization's overview page

This ensures you're working within your secure organization context.

## 2.2 Optional: Configure Primary Domain

If you want to use a custom domain instead of the default subdomain:

1. Go to **Settings → Verified Domains**
2. Click **Set as Primary** for your preferred domain (e.g., `kylehub.dev` instead of `khorg.auth.kylehub.dev`)

## 2.3 Optional: Enable MFA Requirements

To enhance security for your organization:

1. First, add MFA to your account: Go to **Profile → Security → Multi-factor** and enroll an authenticator
2. Then go to **Settings → Login Behavior and Security**
3. Check **"Force MFA for all users"** to require MFA for all users in the organization
4. Optionally disable password-only login if desired

Your organization and account are now properly secured.

## 2.4. Optional: Retire or demote the bootstrap admin

The installation user (`zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost`) exists in the default organization and was meant for initial setup only. After verifying your new organization owner login works:

1. Switch back to the default organization.
2. Sign back in as the bootstrap admin if needed.
3. Remove its project memberships or deactivate the account entirely.

This ensures only the new dedicated account in your organization can administer the environment.
