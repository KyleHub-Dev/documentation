# Post-Installation

## 1. Access Zitadel

Once installation completes, you'll see:

```
Completed Successfully!

ZITADEL setup has been successfully initialized!
Access it using the following URL:

```

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://YOUR_IP:8080/ui/console`
2. Complete the initial setup wizard
3. Create your first organization and admin user

## 2. Retrieve Credentials

Database credentials are stored in the container:

```bash
pct exec <container-id> -- cat ~/zitadel.creds
```

You'll find:
- Database name
- Database user credentials
- Database admin credentials
- Config file location
- Master encryption key

**Important**: Store these credentials securely!

## 3. Configuration File

The Zitadel configuration is located at:
```
/opt/zitadel/config.yaml
```

```bash
~/zitadel-rerun.sh
```

This helper script will:
