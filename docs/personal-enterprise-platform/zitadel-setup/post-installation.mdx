# Post-Installation

## 1. Create Pangolin Resource for Access

Before accessing Zitadel, you need to create a resource in Pangolin to access it through your private LAN:

1. After creating the site, click on the **Resources** tab in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Resource**
3. Configure the Zitadel resource:
   - **Name**: `Zitadel Dashboard` (or any descriptive name)
   - **Resource Type**: `HTTP Resource` (select this since Zitadel expects HTTP internally)
   - **Subdomain**: `auth` (or `auth.yourdomain.com` as the full domain)
   - **Method/Protocol**: `http` (Pangolin handles SSL externally, Zitadel expects HTTP internally)
   - **IP/Hostname**: `192.168.1.51` (Zitadel container's internal IP)
   - **Port**: `8080` (Zitadel web interface port)
4. Click **Save** or **Create**

**Note**: We use HTTP for the Pangolin resource because Zitadel is configured with `ExternalSecure: false`, meaning it expects HTTP traffic internally. Pangolin provides the SSL encryption for external access.

## 2. Access Zitadel

Once installation completes, you'll see:

```
Completed Successfully!

ZITADEL setup has been successfully initialized!
Access it using the following URL:
    http://YOUR_IP:8080/ui/console
```

**Default Login Credentials:**
- **Username**: `zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost`
- **Password**: `Password1!`

**Important**: Change this default password immediately after first login!

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://auth.kylehub.dev/ui/console`
2. Login with the default credentials above
3. The initial setup wizard will guide you through:
   - Creating/changing your organization settings
   - Updating the administrator account
   - Configuring basic settings
4. **Immediately change the default password** to a strong, unique password
5. Save the new credentials securely

## 3. Retrieve Credentials

Database credentials are stored in the container:

```bash
pct exec <container-id> -- cat ~/zitadel.creds
```

You'll find:
- Database name
- Database user credentials
- Database admin credentials
- Config file location
- Master encryption key

**Important**: Store these credentials securely!

## 4. Configuration File

The Zitadel configuration is located at:
```
/opt/zitadel/config.yaml
```

### 4.1 Set External Domain

For Zitadel to work properly when accessed through Pangolin (or any reverse proxy), you need to set the external domain:

1. In Proxmox web interface, click on the Zitadel container (ID 201)
2. Click the **Console** button to open a terminal session
3. Login with your root account credentials

4. Edit the configuration:
```bash
nano /opt/zitadel/config.yaml
```

5. Update the `ExternalDomain` setting:
```yaml
ExternalDomain: auth.kylehub.dev
ExternalSecure: false  # Set to false when using Pangolin (SSL termination handled by Pangolin)
```

6. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

7. Make the rerun script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x ~/zitadel-rerun.sh
~/zitadel-rerun.sh
```

This helper script will:
1. Stop Zitadel
2. Apply configuration changes
3. Restart the service

After running the rerun script, Zitadel should be accessible at `https://auth.kylehub.dev/ui/console`.

**Troubleshooting**: If you get "[unknown] Failed to fetch" errors, especially on user profile pages, check the [Network Configuration troubleshooting](../network-configuration.mdx#212-frontend-api-communication-issues) section.

## 5. Secure Initial Setup

**Important**: After logging in with the default credentials, immediately secure your account and disable self-registration.

1. You should now be logged in with the default administrator account
2. **Change the default password**:
   - Go to your profile/settings
   - Update to a strong, unique password
   - Save the changes
3. **Disable self-registration**:
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **Login Settings** (or **Organization** → **Login Behavior**)
   - Find the "Allow users to register themselves" option
   - Set it to **Disabled** or **Off**
   - Save the changes

This ensures your account is secure and only administrators can create new user accounts.

## 6. Configure User Registration (Optional)

If you want to create users without requiring email verification:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Login Settings**
2. **Disable email verification** for user registration:
   - Look for "Email verification required" or similar option
   - Set it to **Disabled** or **Not Required**
3. **Alternatively, configure SMTP** if you want email verification:
   - Go to **Settings** → **SMTP Settings**
   - Configure your SMTP server details (host, port, credentials)
   - Test the configuration

**Note**: For personal/internal use, disabling email verification is often preferred to avoid SMTP setup complexity.

### 6.1 Alternative: Create Users as Admin (Without Email Verification)

If you prefer to keep email verification enabled but need to create users without SMTP:

1. **Create users directly as an administrator**:
   - Go to **Users** → **Create User**
   - Fill in user details (email, username, etc.)
   - **Important**: Check for options like "Send invitation email" or "Skip email verification"
   - Set a temporary password directly in the user creation form

2. **Retrieve verification codes from Zitadel logs** (if email verification is required):
   ```bash
   # In the container console
   journalctl -u zitadel -f | grep -i "verification\|code\|email"
   ```
   This may show verification codes in the logs.

3. **Check the database directly** (advanced):
   ```bash
   # Access PostgreSQL
   sudo -u postgres psql -d zitadel
   
   # Query for verification codes (be careful with production data)
   SELECT * FROM auth.verification_codes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

**Recommended**: Disable email verification entirely for personal setups - it's simpler and more practical.
