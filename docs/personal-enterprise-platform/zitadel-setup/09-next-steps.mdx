# Next Steps

With the core deployment complete, focus on hardening operations, integrating applications, and expanding identity features.

## Immediate follow-up

1. Review the [Operations & Maintenance](05-operations-maintenance.mdx) checklist and schedule recurring backups and updates.
2. Walk through [Troubleshooting](06-troubleshooting.mdx) to familiarize yourself with common failure modes.
3. Finish the [Pangolin Auth Provider Setup](10-pangolin-auth-provider-setup.mdx) so Zitadel becomes the SSO backbone for Pangolin.

## Build out your IAM platform

- **Integrate applications**: Follow the patterns in [Integration Examples](07-integration-examples.mdx) to onboard web, API, and native clients.
- **Strengthen security**: Enforce MFA, rotate admin credentials, and enable audit logging inside Zitadel.
- **Automate onboarding**: Define custom roles and actions for teams, then script user provisioning with service users or SCIM.
- **Connect external IdPs**: Add social or enterprise identity providers (Google, GitHub, Azure AD) to offer federated logins.
- **Enhance observability**: Ship logs to your SIEM or monitoring stack and configure alerts for failed logins or unusual activity.

## Reference library

- [Official Zitadel Documentation](https://zitadel.com/docs)
- [Zitadel GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel)
- [Proxmox VE Documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/)
- [Community Scripts Documentation](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/)

Keep iterating on these areas as your environment growsâ€”the combination of Pangolin for ingress and Zitadel for IAM scales well when operations, security, and integrations stay in lockstep.
