# Bootstrap Your Zitadel Organization and Central Auth Project

With Zitadel running behind Pangolin, the next step is to replace the bootstrap admin with a dedicated organization and centralized authentication project. This creates a clean separation between the installation's default organization and your personal setup, and establishes a single source of truth for all service access—whether through Pangolin's proxy or direct SSO integrations.

## 1. Create a dedicated organization

1. Log into the Zitadel console using the default administrator account.
2. If not already there, click the **Default Settings** button located next to your profile icon in the top-right corner.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Organizations**.
4. Click the **New** button to create a new organization.
5. **Important**: Uncheck the option **"Use your personal account as organization owner"** since you're logged in with the bootstrap `Zitadel Admin` account.
6. Enter the organization details:
   - **Name**: `KHOps` (or your preferred organization name)
   - **Domain**: `kylehub.dev` (or your domain)
7. Click **Configure Organization Owner** to set up the initial administrator for this organization.
8. Enter the details for your organization owner user (this will be your main managing user):
   - Username, email, and other profile information
   - Select **Email verified** (since email verification may be disabled)
   - Choose **Set Initial Password**
   - Enter a strong, unique password and save it securely (consider using a password manager)
9. Click **Finish** to complete the organization creation.

You should now have your new organization created with a dedicated owner account. Switch to your new organization using the organization selector in the top-left corner.

## 2.1 Switch to Organization Admin Account (Recommended)

After creating the organization, switch to using your dedicated organization admin account:

1. **Logout** from the bootstrap admin account
2. **Login** using the format: `username@domain` (e.g., `yourusername@kylehub.dev`) with the password you set
3. You should now see your organization's overview page

This ensures you're working within your secure organization context.

## 2.2 Optional: Configure Primary Domain

If you want to use a custom domain instead of the default subdomain:

1. Go to **Settings → Verified Domains**
2. Click **Set as Primary** for your preferred domain (e.g., `kylehub.dev` instead of `khops.auth.kylehub.dev`)

## 2.3 Optional: Enable MFA Requirements

To enhance security for your organization:

1. First, add MFA to your account: Go to **Profile → Security → Multi-factor** and enroll an authenticator
2. Then go to **Settings → Login Behavior and Security**
3. Check **"Force MFA for all users"** to require MFA for all users in the organization
4. Optionally disable password-only login if desired

Your organization and account are now properly secured.

## 2.4. Optional: Retire or demote the bootstrap admin

The installation user (`zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost`) exists in the default organization and was meant for initial setup only. After verifying your new organization owner login works:

1. Switch back to the default organization.
2. Sign back in as the bootstrap admin if needed.
3. Remove its project memberships or deactivate the account entirely.

This ensures only the new dedicated account in your organization can administer the environment.

## 3. Create the Central Authentication Project

Instead of creating separate projects for each service, you'll establish a single **KyleHub** project that serves as the unified identity and access control hub for all services—whether proxied through Pangolin or accessed directly via SSO.

### 3.1 Why a unified project?

- **Single source of truth**: All access roles live in one place
- **Simplified SSO**: Services that support OIDC/SAML reuse the same application credentials
- **Easier onboarding**: Grant `homelab` role → instant access to 10+ services
- **Better auditing**: One project authorization log tracks all access
- **Scalable**: Add new service = add one role + one Pangolin rule

### 3.2 Create the project

1. In your organization, navigate to **Projects** and click **New**.
2. Enter the project name: `KyleHub` (or `KyleHub-Core`).
3. Click **Continue** to create the project.

### 3.3 Create the unified OIDC application

1. Inside the `KyleHub` project, go to **Applications → New**.
2. **Important**: Click **"I'm a pro, skip the wizard"** to access the detailed configuration options.
3. Enter the application name: `KyleHub-Auth`.
4. Choose **Web** for the application type.
5. Configure the OAuth/OIDC settings:
   - **Grant Types**: Select **Authorization Code** (leave others unchecked unless needed)
   - **Response Types**: Select **Code** (Authorization Code Flow)
   - **Authentication Method**: Select **Basic** (Client ID and Secret)
6. Leave **Redirect URIs** blank for now—you'll add Pangolin's callback URL in the next guide.
7. Leave **Post Logout URIs** blank (optional).
8. Click **Create** and securely save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that are displayed.

### 3.4 Enable role assertions

1. Navigate back to the **Projects** view and select your **KyleHub** project.
2. Go to the **General** tab in the project settings.
3. Scroll down to the **Settings** section and configure the following:
   - **Assert Roles on Authentication**: Enable this to include role information in tokens and the Userinfo endpoint
   - **Check authorization on Authentication**: (Optional) Enable this to only allow authentication if the user has at least one role assigned
   - **Check for Project on Authentication**: (Optional) Enable this to verify the user's organization has access to this project
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

:::tip
Enabling "Assert Roles on Authentication" is essential for role-based access control. The role information will be included in ID tokens and access tokens when properly configured in the application settings (see next section).
:::

### 3.5 Configure token output

1. Navigate to **Applications → KyleHub-Auth**.
2. Open the **Token Settings** tab.
3. Configure the **Auth Token Type**:
   - **Option A - JWT** (Recommended for Pangolin): Select **JWT** and enable:
     - **Add user roles to the access token** ✓
     - **User roles inside ID Token** ✓
   - **Option B - Bearer** (Default): Select **Bearer**
     - Roles are automatically included in the access token
     - Enable **User roles inside ID Token** ✓
4. (Optional) Enable **User Info inside ID Token** to include profile, email, phone, and address claims
5. (Optional) Configure **ClockSkew** (0-5s) if you need to handle time synchronization issues
6. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
7. Switch to the **URLs** tab and note the **Authorization Endpoint** and **Token Endpoint** for later use.

:::tip Which token type should I use?
- **JWT** is recommended for Pangolin and most reverse proxy setups because:
  - Self-contained tokens can be validated locally without calling Zitadel
  - Faster validation (no introspection endpoint call needed)
  - Works better with stateless authentication
  - You have explicit control over role inclusion
  
- **Bearer** is suitable when:
  - Your application needs to validate tokens against Zitadel's introspection endpoint
  - You prefer opaque tokens for security reasons
  - Roles are automatically included in access tokens
:::

:::warning Important for Pangolin
For Pangolin integration, **JWT** is the recommended choice. Make sure to enable **both** role toggles so roles appear in both the ID token and access token for proper authorization.
:::

## 4. Define Your Role Taxonomy

The power of the unified project comes from a well-structured role catalog. You'll create two types of roles:

- **Category roles**: Broad access to groups of services (e.g., `homelab`, `media`, `finance`)
- **Service-specific roles**: Granular access to individual services (e.g., `access_grafana`, `access_portainer`)

### 4.1 Create category roles

Navigate to **Projects → KyleHub → Roles → New** and create the following:

| Key | Display Name | Description | Group |
|-----|--------------|-------------|-------|
| `admin` | Administrator | Full access to all services and Zitadel management | `categories` |
| `homelab` | Homelab Access | Access to all homelab infrastructure services | `categories` |
| `guest` | Guest Access | Access to public-facing services only | `categories` |

### 4.2 Create service-specific roles

Continue adding roles for each service:

| Key | Display Name | Description | Group |
|-----|--------------|-------------|-------|
| `access_pangolin_ui` | Pangolin UI Access | Access to Pangolin management interface | `services` |
| `access_proxmox` | Proxmox Access | Access to Proxmox virtualization | `services` |
| `access_opnsense` | OPNsense Access | Access to OPNsense firewall | `services` |
| `access_komodo` | Komodo Access | Access to Komodo container management | `services` |

Add more service roles as you expand your infrastructure. Keep the naming convention consistent: `access_<servicename>`.

### 4.3 Role combination strategy

Users can hold multiple roles simultaneously:

- **Admin user**: `admin` role (grants everything)
- **Infrastructure operator**: `homelab` + `access_proxmox` + `access_portainer`
- **Developer**: `homelab` + `access_grafana` + `access_prometheus`
- **Media consumer**: `media` role only
- **External auditor**: `access_grafana` (view-only, configured in Grafana itself)

Pangolin will evaluate all roles when making access decisions, so a user with both `homelab` and `access_grafana` can access Grafana via either rule.

## 5. Grant Initial Access

Grant yourself full administrative access to start:

1. Navigate to **Projects → KyleHub → Authorizations → New**.
2. Select your organization owner account.
3. Choose the `admin` role.
4. Click **Save**.

You can now test authentication and verify the role appears in your token claims (covered in the Pangolin setup guide).

## 6. Next Steps

With your central authentication project established:

1. Configure Pangolin to use the `KyleHub-Auth` application (see [Pangolin Auth Provider Setup](./05-pangolin-auth-provider-setup.mdx))
2. Define access rules in Pangolin that enforce category and service roles
3. Optionally configure services like Grafana or Proxmox to use the same `KyleHub-Auth` credentials for direct SSO
4. Add users and grant them appropriate role combinations as your team grows

Your unified authentication hub is now ready to serve as the identity foundation for your entire infrastructure.
